      We are fighting a war with no front
      lines, since the enemy hides among
      the people, in the jungles and mountains,
      and uses covertly border areas of neutral
      countries. One cannot measure progress by
      lines on a map.

      Gameplay is divided between two map screens. The Regional
      Map shows the region of operations, the interior highlands
      and coast of South Vietnam. The Local Map shows the terrain
      immediately surrounding the squad.

      Below each map screen, are the Command and Squad panels. The
      Command panel shows each available command the player may give
      in the particular context. The Squad panel shows the date and
      time, as well as the individual status of each squad member.

      As the squad marches over the Regional map, time will elapse
      and squad members will deplete Presence (♣). Resting will
      replenish Presence (♣) while also elapsing time.`
